### Project Title
## Investigate a Relational Database with PostgreSQL


### Description
Solve below questionnaires by SQL.

**Question 1**
 Want to understand more about the movies that families are watching.The following categories are considered family movies: Animation, Children, Classics, Comedy, Family and Music.Create a query that lists each movie, the film category it is classified in, and the number of times it has been rented out.


**Question 2**
provide a table with the family-friendly film category, each of the quartiles,and the corresponding count of movies within each combination of film category for each corresponding rental duration category.The resulting table should have three columns:
Category, Rental length category ,Count.

**Question 3**
We want to find out how the two stores compare in their count of rental orders during every month for all the years we have data for. Write a query that returns the store ID for the store, the year and month and the number of rental orders each store has fulfilled for that month. Your table should include a column for each of the following: year, month, store ID and count of rental orders fulfilled during that month.


**Question 4**
Finally, for each of these top 10 paying customers, I would like to find out the difference across their monthly payments during 2007. Please go ahead and write a query to compare the payment amounts in each successive month. Repeat this for each of these 10 paying customers. Also, it will be tremendously helpful if you can identify the customer name who paid the most difference in terms of payments.
